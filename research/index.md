The Dias Lab is broadly interested in the genetics of neurodevelopment. We are interested in better understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and intellectual disability.  In order to do this, we are tackling two major challenges in the field- cellular and clinical heterogeneity.

### Cellular Heterogeneity:
The brain is an amazingly complex and heterogeneous tissue and is not immediately accessible for study in the human condition. We are interested in studying the molecular perturbations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in different cellular subtypes in the human brain specifically. In order to do this, we are applying single cell genomic approaches on post-mortem human brain to identify cell-type and region-specific molecular changes related to neurodevelopment.

### Clinical Heterogeneity:
Neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder are remarkably heterogeneous, and yet, converge on a shared set of clinical symptoms. In order to make sense of this heterogeneity, the Dias Lab is interested in studying specific genetic disorders associated with neurodevelopmental disorders to identify shared and divergent molecular drivers.

The Dias Lab believes that the synergistic use of both approaches will shed light on fundamental mechanisms related to human neurodevelopment.
