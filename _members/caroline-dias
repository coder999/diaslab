Caroline was born in Denver but grew up mostly in the beautiful garden state of NJ. She received her BA from Cornell University in Ithaca NY, studying Neurobiology and Behavior. Her undergraduate research experiences included chasing ants with poker chips at the University of Colorado Field Research Station. She subsequently did her MD, PhD at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in NYC, where she completed her dissertation with Dr. Eric Nestler, studying the molecular neurobiology of addiction and depression in mouse models.  She did Pediatrics internship/residency at the Boson Combined Residency Program and completed the accelerated research track into Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Fellowship, also at Boston Children’s Hospital. It was during her fellowship training that she became interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders. She was fortunate to work in the laboratory of Dr. Christopher Walsh, where she learned about the amazing power of human genetics to illuminate fundamental mechanisms in neurobiology. The mountains called her back to Colorado and she is excited to be starting her lab at the Anschutz Medical Campus. Caroline works clinically in Developmental Pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Colorado when not in the lab.  Outside of clinic and the lab, Caroline loves exploring Colorado with her husband Mark and their dachshund/toy poodle mix Hazel.

The Dias Lab welcomes applications from individuals at all levels who have an interest in studying the genetics of neurodevelopment.  Please send your letter of interest and a CV to Caroline Dias.
